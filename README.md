# Gradescope API
This is an initial attempt at reverse engineering gradescope to allow for automated submissions and controlling other
behaviour in an automated way as there is no official gradescope API.

Some initial endpoint info was [gotten from this MIT paper](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2016/files/20.pdf).
